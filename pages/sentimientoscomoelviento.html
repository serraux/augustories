The knight had a strange of feeling of pain inside his body. This happened to him every afternoon when the hourglass was marked at 4 pm. He touched his body trying to discover the exact place but he knew he would not find it.
                         He went into his room and looked out the window towards the horizon trying to find an answer to it. 
                         <p class="text-left p-4 bg-white"> One day that the silence was interrupted by the voice of the princess.</p>
                       
                       <p class="text-left p-4 bg-sky-50"> &#8220;What are you thinking?&#8221;-- she asked.</p>
                        <p class="text-left p-4 bg-white">&#8220;Did you know that feelings are like the wind?&#8221; -- he answered.</p>
                        <p class="text-left p-4 bg-sky-50">He noticed the thoughtful princess; perhaps she was trying to give her best answer. </p>
                       <p class="text-left p-4 bg-white"> &#8220;You say that because these passes very quickly&#8221;-- she answered.</p>
                        <p class="text-left p-4 bg-sky-50">For some reason, he felt that the beautiful woman would not understand his words.  However, the princess approached him naturally and as he touched her face, she touched his skin in a little area that his suit left uncovered.  This contact between the two people turned out to be the best answer to the question that he pondered. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-left p-4 bg-white">It is exactly that happen -- he answered to her -- you cannot see feelings such as you cannot see the wind but you know they exist when they touch your body, Sometimes the touch is so subtle that they give the sensation of a caress, and at other times they are so strong that they can uproot everything, just as it happened to the forest in front of us.
                        </p>
                       <p class="text-left p-4 bg-sky-50"> The princess was analyzing what she had heard and said:</p>

                       <p class="text-left p-4 bg-white">&#8220;Nature is strange, she herself allows her winds to destroy part of her creation.&#8221;</p>

                       <p class="text-left p-4 bg-sky-50"> &#8220;What you say is very interesting. Although knowing why it should be much better&#8221;, he answered.</p>
